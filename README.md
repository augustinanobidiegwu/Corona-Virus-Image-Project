# Corona-Virus-Image-Project
This project focused on analyzing and classifying COVID-related X-ray images categorized into chest, knee, and wrist classes. The data preprocessing steps included converting images to grayscale, normalizing pixels, performing feature extraction, and augmenting images. It involves using chest, wrist, and knee X-ray images sourced from different datasets on Kaggle. The chest images (1600) are from the CoronaHack Chest X-ray dataset, the wrist images (2000) are from the RSNA Bone Age dataset, and the knee images (1000) are from the MedicalExpert-I folder in the Digital Knee X-ray dataset.
